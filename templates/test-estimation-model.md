# ⏱️ Test Estimation Model

This template demonstrates a structured approach to estimating QA effort during sprint planning or release planning.

---

## 🎯 Estimation Factors

* Feature complexity
* Integration dependencies
* Test data preparation
* Automation feasibility
* Environment readiness

## 📊 Example Estimation Table

| Feature          | Complexity | Test Type              | Estimated Effort |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Login Flow       | Medium     | UI + API               | 1.5 Days         |
| Checkout Process | High       | UI + API + Exploratory | 3 Days           |
| Profile Update   | Low        | Functional             | 0.5 Day          |

## 🧮 Estimation Guidelines

### Small Change

* Minor UI updates
* Existing automation reusable

👉 0.5 – 1 day

### Medium Feature

* New workflows
* Moderate API coverage

👉 1 – 2 days

### Large Feature

* Multiple integrations
* New automation framework updates

👉 3+ days

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

* Estimation refined with developers during grooming
* Risks documented early
* Buffer added for exploratory testing

---

⭐ Goal: Provide transparent, predictable QA timelines aligned with Agile delivery.
